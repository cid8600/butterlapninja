      <div id="FAQ" class="second-header">Frequently Asked Questions</div>

      <p><b>How many people usually come?</b> (1 - ?). The Butterlap Ninja ride welcomes everyone that wants to kick their OG Butterlap ride up a notch. <br><span class="ninja">This is an advanced paced ride.</span></p>

      <p><b>What kind of people come to the Butterlap Ninja ride?</b> The same people that rock the OG Butterlap... awesome, caring, fabulous bike-people!</p>

      <p><b>How fast do people pedal?</b> The Butterlap Ninja ride is for those that feel comfortable pedaling hard and moving fast. Riders are responsible for their own speeds. Ninjas have found that the route takes approximately 1 hour 30 minutes of total riding time at an average speed of 13 miles per hour. The Butterlap Ninja ride makes one 15 minute stop to socialize, refuel, regroup and meet up with the OG Butterlap crew.</p>

      <p><b>What kind of bike should I bring?</b> Bring the bike you feel most comfortable riding: road, cross, fix, mountain, uni, tall... Ninjas never hate on bike types. Please be prepared to ride 18 miles with a 1000 feet accumulative climb. Most riders have tools and repair kits to help fellow riders in a bind, but for the most part, you will be responsible for your own safety and gear.</p>

      <p><b>What else should I bring?</b> Whatever makes you ride fast and hard. Music, booze, a lizard in your bike shorts, a picture of your parents during sexy times... Ninjas never discrimenate. It also might be a good idea to wear a layer or two as this ride goes along the ocean and it can get a bit cold over there.</p>

      <p><b>What time does the ride end?</b> The Butterlap Ninja ride is approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes of riding and a 15 minute social hangout with the OG Butterlap crew. Ninjas expect to be at Bender's around 9:15pm.</p>

      <p><b>What is the "Coaster Race"?</b> What does "coasting" mean?</p>

      <p><b>Why is it called "Butterlap Ninja"?</b> The Butterlap Ninja ride started when there were enough riders from the OG Butterlap that wanted a bit more of a physical challenge on their Wednesday eves. Please note: Ninjas love, love, LOVE the OG Butterlap. Ninjas respect every part of the OG Butterlap's history and culture.</p>

      <p><b>Is there an awesome video I can watch?</b> No. But there may be someday if you can catch us ;-)</p>
