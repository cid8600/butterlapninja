<div style="font-size:40px" id="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</div>
<p><b>How many people usually come?</b> Our numbers range from 5-25 people with an average of about 10.</p>

<p><b>What kind of people come?</b> Some people have work attire, others have normal clothes on, others wear cycling gear. Everyone is pretty chill, social and welcoming. Prepare to sweat. </p>

<p><b>How fast do people pedal?</b> It's a group ride that is slightly faster than Bike Party or Critical Mass. It's not ridicuously fast but not slow either. There are multiple stops with people paying attention to who is still riding, so usually nobody gets left behind. </p>

<p><b>What kind of bike should I bring?</b> People bring all sorts of bikes for this ride - single speed, mountain bike, road bike, etc. Anything with a few gears is recommended for first-timers. </p>

<p><b>What else should I bring?</b> A warm jacket, gloves, a bottle of water and some lights are recommended. Bringing a six pack or flask to share earns you extra points :)

<p><b>What time does the ride end?</b> Usually we get to Bender's between 9:30-10:00PM.

<p><b>What is the "Coaster Race"?</b> It is a totally optional race that starts at Stop 4 (Clement & 34th), which is the start of a long decent around Point Lobos and down to Ocean Beach. Participants pedal for a short while, then coast all the way downt he hill. The goal is to see how far you can get with sheer inertia alone. It's a distance race, not a time race! Everyone regroups at Stop 5 (Ocean Beach).</p>

<p><b>Why is it called "Butterlap"?</b> We're not really sure. Many different opinions exist on how the ride got it's name - one of which is it rarely has any stop signs of traffic lights, making the ride silky smooth like butter. </p>

<p> There are multiple stories about it's origin. Some say it started as a cyclocross training ride, others say that it started as a Sports Basement ride. The stories point to the ride starting around 2006. Since then it has been a spontaneous thing that happens every Wednesday (almost) without fail.
